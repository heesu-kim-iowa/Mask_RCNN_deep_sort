# Mask_RCNN_deep_sort
Intergrated model of Mask R-CNN and DeepSORT
# Note
* GPU running is slower than CPU running
* If the `tensorflow-gpu` package is installed and then uninstalled, the error is occured. It will force you to rebuild the virtual environment.
* Additional external packages are in `/addtionalPackage/` directory. Copy the packages and past to the virtual environment.
* `cv2` package is actually `opencv-python` package. Install `opencv-python` instead of `cv2`.
